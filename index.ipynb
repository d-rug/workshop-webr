        "[WebR](https://r-wasm.org) is a tool that lets you run R code in the browser *on the client side*. You may know that Web browsers only know three languages: `html`, `css`, and `javascript`. So, WebR is a port of the R source code to javascript. This is accomplished by some tools (beyond the scope of this presentation) that automatically convert C code to an intermediate language called `WebAssembly`.\n",

There's also [this list of resources about WebR](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-webr) with better variety and more examples to draw from. And, you can always post questions on the [D-RUG question forum](https://d-rug.discourse.group) for help from the group.\n",

That template is for a Quarto project, so you will need to install Quarto to use it, but I recommend using Quarto to build your website, anyway. \n"
